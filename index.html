    <h2>Scouting</h2>
    <p>
      You may recognize scouts for ”being prepared” or outdoorsy, but there is
      much more to it than that. The mission of scouting is to preparing youth
      for life! To prepare scouts to make good choices, the scouting program
      focuses on character development, leadership development, citizenship
      training, and personal fitness. Our scouting units are blessed to partner
      with Stone Oak Church.

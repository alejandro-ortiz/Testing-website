<h1>Scouts 226 Website</h1>
<p>To test locally, you need to have a recent-ish version of ruby installed (ruby
2.4 or newer). Run the following to get up and running:</p>
<pre><code>gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve -l
</code></pre>
<p>That should install jekyll and its dependencies, then start a live server.</p>
<h2>Layouts</h2>
<p>If you write a simlpe page, often in markdown for the website, you will probably
use the <code>default</code> layout. It has a single row and a 12 column div ready for your
content. If your page has multiple rows, the <code>main</code> layout is what you want. In
this layout, you are responsible for creating your own divs for the rows and
columns.</p>

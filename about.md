## Activities

Some of the fun events that our pack does throughout the year include Family
Campouts, service projects, monthly activities, and the celebration of our Arrow
of Light Den crossing over to the Boy Scouts Troop at our annual Blue and Gold
Banquet in February.

Our troops typically camp one weekend a month and provide scouts with several
summer camp options including high-adventure!

## Faith

As a ministry of Stone Oak Church, Chaplain's minutes and prayers are a part of every meeting
and outing for all our scouts. The number 226 is based on Proverbs 22:6, which
says:

> Train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it.

As a partner of Stone Oak Church, we incorporate the teaching of biblical
principles that are consistent with [Stone Oak Church Statement of Faith].

<p><em>From the Scouts BSA Handbook, 14th Edition...</em></p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO DO WHEN LOST</strong></p>
<p>One day you might accidentally wander off a trail and be unsure how to find it again. Perhaps
you will take a wrong turn and not know which way to go. If you think you are lost, stop where you
are and follow the four steps that spell STOP.</p>
<p><strong>Stay calm.</strong> Sit down and have some water and something to eat. If you are cold, put on a jacket
or sweater. Breathe slowly and relax.</p>
<p><strong>Think.</strong> Try to remember how you got where you are. If you have a map, open it and see what
you can learn from the symbols and contour lines.</p>
<p><strong>Observe.</strong> Look for your footprints in soft ground or snow. Notice any landmarks that can be
clues to your location. Listen for sounds of other Scouts.</p>
<p><strong>Plan.</strong> If you are convinced that you know which way to go to get back on track, move carefully.
Use a compass to set a bearing in the direction of your destination. Then clearly mark the way you
are going with broken branches, piles of stones, or whatever else is handy in case you need to find
your way back to the spot where you've been sitting. However, if you don't have a clear idea where
you are, stay where you are. People will start looking for you as soon as someone realizes you are
missing.</p>

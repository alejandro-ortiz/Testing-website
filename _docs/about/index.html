    <p><a href="https://www.scouting.org/">Scouting</a> is a game with a purpose! It is fun because scouts learn by doing fun
activities with their family and friends. They wear the scout uniform, serve
their community, learn scout skills, explore the outdoors, build
self-confidence, develop an understanding of the scout ideals, and learn
leadership skills... all to become their very best future selves.</p>
<p>Scouting is for all youth! Our youngest scouts can begin their adventure as a
<a href="https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/">Cub Scout</a> in Pack 226 when they are in kindergarten. The Pack serves both boys
and girls up through the fifth grade, at which point they can join one of our
two troops in <a href="https://www.scouting.org/programs/scouts-bsa/">Scouts BSA</a>. Both troops serve scouts from sixth grade up through
18 years old.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.communitybible.com/">Community Bible Church</a> (CBC) is our fantastic partner! You can find us meeting
most Monday nights during the school year on the first floor of the Education
Building, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/445cix8PCb4HMVE39">2477 N Loop 1604 E</a>.</p>
<p>The Pack and both troops, all begin at their meetings at 7:00. The Cub Scouts
wrap up by 8:00 and the troops end between 8:15 and 8:30.</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Some of the fun events that our pack does throughout the year include Family
Campouts, service projects, monthly activities, and the celebration of our Arrow
of Light Den crossing over to the Boy Scouts Troop at our annual Blue and Gold
Banquet in February.</p>
<p>Our troops typically camp one weekend a month and provide scouts with several
summer camp options including high-adventure!</p>
<h3>Faith</h3>
<p>As a ministry of CBC, Chaplain's minutes and prayers are a part of every meeting
and outing for all our scouts. The number 226 is based on Proverbs 22:6, which
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a partner of Community Bible Church, we incorporate the teaching of biblical
principles that are consistent with <a href="https://www.communitybible.com/what-we-believe/">CBC Statement of Faith</a>.</p>
